nms is nms.csail.mit.edu and has three objects (/, favicon, nms_logo)
All objects are on the same server (so its a good way to test deadlocking on bulk thread)


amazon is a large site but is good test because it requires you to be pending on other threads (objects are pending while bulk response is being parsed on another thread)
so it tests conditon variables well.
